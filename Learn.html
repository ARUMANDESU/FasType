                        <p>
                            Touch typing is all about the idea that each finger has its own area on the keyboard. Thanks to that fact you can type without looking at the keys. Practice regularly and your fingers will learn their location on the keyboard through muscle memory.

                            <li>Keep at least 45 - 70 cm of distance between your eyes and the screen.</li>
                            <li>Еxpose the shoulder, arm, and wrist muscles to the least possible strain. The wrists can touch the tabletop in front of the keyboard. Never shift your body weight to the wrists by resting on them.</li>

                        <p>Curve your fingers a little and put them on the ASDF and JKL; keys which are located in the middle row of the letter keys. This row is called HOME ROW because you always start from these keys and always return to them.</p>
                        <p>F and J keys under your index fingers should have a raised line on them to aide in finding these keys without looking.</p>

                        <p>Limit your hand and finger movement only to what is necessary to press a specific key. Keep your hands and fingers close to the base position. This improves typing speed and reduces stress on the hands.</p>
                        <p>Pay attention to ring fingers and little fingers, since they are considerably underdeveloped.</p>
