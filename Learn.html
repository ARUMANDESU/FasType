                    <p>
                        Touch typing is all about the idea that each finger has its own area on the keyboard. Thanks to that fact you can type without looking at the keys. Practice regularly and your fingers will learn their location on the keyboard through muscle memory.

                        <li>Еxpose the shoulder, arm, and wrist muscles to the least possible strain. The wrists can touch the tabletop in front of the keyboard. Never shift your body weight to the wrists by resting on them.</li>

                    <p>F and J keys under your index fingers should have a raised line on them to aide in finding these keys without looking.</p>

                    <p>Limit your hand and finger movement only to what is necessary to press a specific key. Keep your hands and fingers close to the base position. This improves typing speed and reduces stress on the hands.</p>
                    <p>Pay attention to ring fingers and little fingers, since they are considerably underdeveloped.</p>
